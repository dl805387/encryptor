# Encryptor
This program allows the user to encrypt and decrypt passwords and/or messages. My motivation for creating this project is that I am interested in encryption for better security and I also wanted to create a project where I can learn Python. While creating this project, I have also learned some Pandas and using Python GUI toolkit Tkinter.

## Features
* Program allows both encryption and decryption
* Encryption is done using a combination of UTF-8 character encoding and Caesar cipher
* Decryption is done by working backwards with the character encoding and shifting backwards with the Caesar cipher
* Pandas is used to read the encryption key csv file and for UTF-8 character-byte mapping
* GUI is built using the Tkinter library

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Tkinter
